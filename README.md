# Firewalla Public Lists

Welcome to **Firewalla Public Lists** -- a community-maintained collection of optional blocklists and other curated datasets for Firewalla devices.

This repo exists to provide:
- **Optional** lists for users who want extra filtering or categorization
- **Transparency** around what's included
- **Community contributions** to keep lists accurate and up-to-date
- **A central place** for Firewalla users to share curated, useful datasets
These lists are **not required** for Firewalla operation. They are strictly optional tools for users who want them.

## Current Lists
- NSFW AI List

## Contributing
We welcome all community contributions! 

How to contribute:
- Clone this repo and create a **Pull Request** to add, remove, or refine entries
- Include a brief explanation for each change
- Use one domain per line

Optionally, you can also create an **issue** of the site you'd like to be included, and we'll take a look.

## Disclaimer
These lists are community-curated and may not be 100% complete or accurate. 
Use at your own discretion. Firewalla does not guarantee the behavior of third-party domains, nor does it mandate the use of these lists.
